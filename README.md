## üì° API & Data

### Mock API Implementation

This project uses **Next.js API Routes** for mock data:

- **Leaderboard API**: `/api/leaderboard` - Returns 50 fake leaderboard entries
- **Mock Data**: Generated dynamically with realistic app names, creators, and metrics
- **No External Dependencies**: All data is generated server-side using Next.js API routes

### Wallet Connection (Demo Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The wallet connection is **fake/demo only** for showcase purposes:

- **No Real Blockchain Integration**: Wallet connect is simulated
- **Mock Wallet Address**: Shows placeholder wallet addresses
- **UI Demonstration**: Designed to showcase the user experience
- **Not Production Ready**: Do not use for actual wallet connections

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
